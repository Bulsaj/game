# Momentum Mod
![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9hpr4p9suvlge305?svg=true)

Momentum Mod is a free, stand-alone Source Engine mod, based on Counter-Strike: Source movement physics.
This project is dedicated to bhop and surfing, while not only trying to replicate them, but also trying to improve them. 
Our goal is to make it easier to access and play (offline and online) as well as being cheaper (did we mention it's free?)
than any other Source game you'd have to buy to play either of these game modes.
