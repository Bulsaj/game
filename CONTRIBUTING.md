# About Contributing
Contributing to this project is very easy. Just fork the repo, make your desired changes
and then send us a pull request and we'll happily revise it.

Note: We use Hungarian Notation (Systems), spaces instead of tabs, and ClangFormat for any custom file added to the project.

If your work is to be used in our project, we will credit you with a Contributor role on [our credits page.](http://momentum-mod.org/about) If you wish to have a certain name in this credit, make sure to mention it in the comments of your Pull Request, otherwise, we'll just use your GitHub username.

If we like your work enough, we may invite you to be on the team!

If you have any other concerns, feel free to [contact us!](http://momentum-mod.org/contact)

**All the help we can get is very welcome!**


Also, *as this is a Source mod*, VALVe's contributing conditions apply here as well:


*As a condition of providing a Contribution, you agree that:* 
- *You grant Valve a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license
to make, use, sell, reproduce, modify, distribute (directly and indirectly),
and publicly display and perform the Contribution, and any derivative works
that Valve may make from the Contribution, under any intellectual property you
own or have the right to license.* 
- *You warrant and represent that the Contribution is your original creation,
that you have the authority to grant this license to Valve, and that this
license does not require the permission of any third party.  Otherwise, you
provide your Contribution "as is" without warranties.*

*Should you wish to submit a suggestion or work that is not your original
creation, you may submit it to Valve separate from any Contribution,
explicitly identifying it as sourced from a third party, stating the details
of its origin, and informing Valve of any license or other restriction of
which you are personally aware.*
